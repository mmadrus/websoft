                        This is not the first time that I have used Git, however, previous experiences has been through both the built in GitHub client in Intellij as well as the desktop client. It is therefore 
                        refreshing to get some experience with git using the command line. It is also the first time that I have used GitHub pages, mostly because I did not know it existed and never had the need to use it before. It is still a good tool to use for web development by having somewhere to test your website during development without having the need to have a custom domain. I have not previously used tools such as Markdown or other tools like it.

                        I have done websites before but started very recently (December 2019) by learning it on my spare time. I managed to develop a portfolio (<a href="http://www.madrusan.xyz">www.madrusan.xyz</a>) which is still under development as it is not responsive yet. However, I had a previous version that was responsive but recently created a new one as the previous did
                        not feel professional enough and was made in a haste. Therefore, I have some knowledge and experience with web development but would need to learn a structured approach towards it. Which is what I hope I will learn during this course. During the previous project course, I have also used simpler networking functions in js to be able to connect a website to a server. This was done by using both REST API calls with ajax and using WebSockets.
                        The website was then connected to a java based web server. Even though I have some experience with web development, I do feel that I have only touched the surface of the subject.

                    I have previously had some experience with HTML, CSS & JavaScript. However, most of the JS had been done together with jQuery. Therefore, I do not have used JS with application logic but for manipulating the front-end of the web application. So most of my web development experience have been with HTML and CSS.

                    HTML, CSS and JS plays different parts in web development. HTML creates the structure of the a page. By creating different elements, a developer is able to structure how the visuals should be set up. CSS applies visual style to the HTML elements. JS creates the logic behind the HTML, this is to make the website more dynamic. JS also makes the 
                    site more interactive for the user. Furthermore, JS takes care of all logic behind the visual that the users can see. This means that JS allows the developer to do a lot of logic 'behind the curtains' which makes a web application more dynamic. All together, HTML sets the scene, CSS applies visuals to the scene which JS handles everything behind
                    the curtains.

                    The browser and the web server creates a client-server structure. In which the client (browser) fetches data or sends data to the server which handles the information. In this way, the server works as a back-end for the browser. HTTP (Hypertext transfer
                    protocol) creates a uniform way in which all browsers and alla web server are able to transfer data between each other 
                    in the same way.

                    Not a lot of new things have been learned during this section of the course. As I have had previous knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS. We have also learned of the client-server structure and how network communication works. However, it is always good
                    to refresh previous knowledge.

                    I have previously had some experience with JavaScript, however, it has often been combined with jQuery so manipulate HTML elements depending on different actions. JS is a little different from languages previously learned in the programme. As Java is strictly object-oriented, JS has other properties which gives the language its unique features. As JS operates with objects, it does not enforce the developer to follow object-oriented principles, such as Java. Therefore, JS is comparable with other languages such as C# and Java as they all work with objects. Hence, JS can be related to other popular languages as it works with objects while it does not enforce OOP principles as other languages might do.

                    I was aiming for grade 5 in this assignment. Firstly, I looked at the different requirements for each grade. I then decided to work on the school part, then the flag and lastly the moving object. As I knew that I was aiming for grade 5, I immediately started to work on a dynamic HTML table. This was done by creating an empty table and dynamically fill it
                    from the JSON file of the chosen school district code. The flags was easily implemented as each flag was put in its own div and each color of the flag was a div of itself. In the end, each flag consisted of a div which had 3 divs. Lastly, the moving object was implemented by adding an element to each HTML. This element was given a random X and Y position in which it fades away, move to given position and then fades in at the new position. Overall, I'm satisfied with the code and feel that I have reached the grade I aimed for.

                    I've learned new ways to use JS to dynamically updated or create elements as well as manipulating it in different ways. I've also learned that JS can be used in multiple ways to fit the need of the application which makes it a very versatile language.

                        I have not previously worked with node. However, I have used node/npm to install frameworks or such for other projects. It was therefore a new experience to actually work with it in a programming way. Using together with JS and Express has been
                        challenging. Mostly because it is the first time working in such a structure as the frameworks creates. It is a client-server type of workflow, however, the middleware and the routing is new for me. It has been one of the more challenging tasks during 
                        the programme.

However, it took some time before I understood how it all is connected. I did not really have a plan to start with as I did not quite understand how to structure the code. When I understood that, it was easy to set up a plan and follow it. The plan worked when I finally could grasp what was asked for in the assignment and the watching the lectures a couple of times. As the I had a hard time to grasp the assignment I aimed for grade 3 as I felt that I did not want to spent too much time on the assignment as there are multiple things to focus on in both this course and other courses.

                        How to structure a simple node and express application. It is seem close to a MVC workflow and when having a better understanding, it could be used to structure more complex applications in a simpler way. Modules are very useful tool when creating parts of an application as it can make it more dynamic without adding too much code to a single page.

                        My opinion on PHP is neutral as it is the first time using it. However, it is easy to understand the basics of it. It seem very useful when doing smaller functions for a web application, I have also seen it being used for simpler forms used on websites when sending an e-mail or similar smaller tasks. Even though it is useful, I do not see PHP 
                        being used when creating larger projects. As PHP is used as controller for the views, more complex web applications would need another language and process to make those applications as efficient as possible. Some of those are, for example, JS with Node JS and C# with MS MVC. These seem more appropriate for larger projects. Therefore, PHP is more similar to JS and C# in its functionality and closer to JS in syntax.

I quickly understood that PHP would work as a controller and setting the footer/header as a separate file would work as a template for the other pages. I did however struggle with the instructions as I did not quite understand them in the beginning but after rewatching the lectures, they became more apparent.

                        I learned the basic syntax of PHP. I also learned the functionality of the language and why it is used. However, PHP is a bit more complicated than I thought and that the language has a bigger threshold than I thought. Either way, the assignment was little challenging but was a good experience.

                            Looking over which programming languages that are used the most. JS, Python and Java are usually in the top 3 and it seem that these three will stay on top for a while. As a lot of programming languages has become popular and slowly disappeared from the programming scene, it seem as the market of programming languages as settled. This is good for programmers as having too many languages to choose from with different frameworks can complicate the work process for programmers. Therefore, it is good that a lot of companies use the same type of languages which allows programmers to learn 
                            them more in depth depending on what career path they are taking. This allows for a more fluent work market as programmers can change jobs more often but more importantly, the quality of applications increase. The longer a language stays popular, the better will the quality of the language and applications be because the programmers have more time to master it and the language itself will have more time to be supported and developed. Therefore, I think that the popular programming languages at this moment will stay popular but over time will change to another version of itself that is more efficient and more powerful.

                            My personal choice of programming languages will depend on what is supported and developed but as well as what the employer wants me to use. This is the major reasoning behind choosing programming languages. However, some languages will still be of 
                            interest depending on what projects I have on my spare time.

                            I choose to compare the three previously mentioned programming languages and see which ones has the most searches and in what context it is searched in. Currently, of all the three languages worldwide, Java has the most overall searches. However,
                            Java is searched in other contexts other than programming, in this case both are within the context of entertainment. The top search including Java is a new Indian movie called Mar Java. The third and fifth most searched Java term was related to Minecraft Java edition. However, the second and third is programming related as the terms are Java 13 and 
                            (some programming problem) followed by in Java. For Python, the search term are more related to programming problems and basic tutorials in form of w3schools. One of the Python search terms are payton which is properly because a lot of people misspell 
                            the word. The search terms for both Python and Java does have terms related to programming problems. For JS however, it is a different story. Even though it is programming related, the search terms related to JS are all for different frameworks but not the most used ones such as React and Vue, but for smaller frameworks such as Nuxt JS and Svelte JS.

                            set up a scalable database with pointers.

                        .NET is a developer platform developed by Microsoft to allow developers to create a large array of applications based on the structure. With .NET, the developers are able to create web apps, mobile apps, desktop apps and so on. It is compatible with a couple of languages but the most common one is C#. C# is an objective oriented programming language that was also developed by Microsoft and is very similar to Java in its syntax. The .NET platform includes multiple libraries that could be used for different purposes. Such as ASP.NET for web applications and Xamarin for mobile applications. ASP.NET is an extension of the .NET platform to create a common place for structuring web apps. This includes web-page templating with Razor, which allows the developer to create templates for the visual pages by using C#. The extension also adds different design patterns,
                        such as the Model-View-Controller pattern (MVC) in which the views can be templated with C# and completed with HTML, CSS and JS. While the models and controllers are made up with C#, were the controllers creates business logic for the app.

                        The .NET platform can be compared with the likes of Node JS, Express and front-end frameworks such as React JS. The templating helps the developer to create modules which can be used for front-end pages similar to React JS, however, it is not unusual
                        that both of these are used together. Node JS and Express are similar to the back-end part of the dotnet platform, were the controllers are handle different API calls from the front-end and .NET runs the application.

                    For this assignment, I have chosen <a href="../../../../youtube.audit.html">Youtube</a>, <a href="../../../../reddit-audit.html">Reddit</a> and <a href="../../../../aplice-audit.html">Splice</a> to analyze. The reasoning for this is that those are the three
                    websites I use the most and therefore, it feels logical to test the performance of those sites. All of the websites showed poor performance, with Youtube having the worst and Splice having the best. This comes as a surprise as all the has a lot of daily traffic,
                    even though Splice does not have the same amount of traffic as the other two websites, it does have its fair share as it is one
                    of the main platforms to download stems for music production. This might also be the reason for Youtube having the worst one. It is one of the most used social platforms around the world and it has to load a lot more than data than Splice and Reddit.
                    Reddit does also generate a lot of data, however, it does rely on websites such as Youtube and Imgur to host pictures and videos. Both Splice and Youtbe scored well on accessibility while Reddit score was worse. However, Youtube as well as Reddit had issues
                    with ARIA. While Reddit did not have some elements adapted to ARIA, Youtube did, but it did still come across as an accessibility issue through Lighthouse. Reddit had the best practices while the other two websites performed worse. However, they all had one 
                    issue in common and that was linking to cross-origin destinations. Most of these are links to social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, but Youtube had a issue with leaving the link target with blank. Both Splice and Youtube also displayed images with 
                    the wrong aspect ratio. All three websites scored well on the search engine optimization part of the audit.

                        tool to use as it was fast and displayed the information in a very simple way. The websites has different ways to improve their performances, however, they all suffer from unused CSS files which would marginally improve the performance. They also 
                        suffer from offscreen images which slows down the websites by a lot, most on Youtube as it is the largest one. Therefore, it would help the sites to not use images that are not used on the screen at the time of showing.

                    I learned different ways of analyzing the performance of a website and how small programming issues can result in larger performance issues. It is therefore important to thoroughly check your applications as they can cause issues which can give the user a negative experience, such as not adapting the website for ARIA.

                        Security has not been one of the top priorities during the programme as the projects has had more focus on user features. Therefore, all of the projects has had one or more security flaws that happen to be in the OWASP top ten list. The most common one
                        would be using components with known vulnerabilities as the features that the group wanted to implement has not been available in the original framework of use and therefore used frameworks and APIs that was not secure in the sense of how the data is handled.
                        But the concern for a hacker to try to exploit them was very low. Sensitive Data Exposure has also been very common during the projects. The data in the databases has more often than not been open for everyone that has access to the database because it has not been
                        encrypted in some way. This has also been accompanied with injections as database security has not been a priority.

                        In the future, more focus will be put into the security of web applications as such problems can have great repercussions and harm the users badly. As most services such as banks and medical journals are accessible on the internet through web apps, it even more important that such services goes great lengths to secure the data and accessibility.

                        To avoid all these problems, one should first of all secure the users data by not exposing it to attackers. This could be done by encrypting the data and prevent injections, e.g. using prepared statements in SQL to avoid data dropping from the database by attackers. Read documentation thoroughly to avoid problems such as broken authentication. Learning the documentation can help developers to avoid multiple threats which will help them to correctly implement the security features.

                    I learned that the common practices during the programme would result in large problems for users. It is therefore important to read and understand what I am doing as a developer to ensure that users do not come in harm because of my lack of knowledge. The videos with the hacker explaining and discussing the threats gave a very good insight on common practices used during
                    the programme.

            We decided to divide the project into two parts: front-end and back-end. Therefore, we also divided the team into two.
            Two would work on the the front-end and two on the back-end. The team worked well and communicated well with each other.
            We had set up how the information in will be strucutred when sending between the different parts of the application, and 
            decided to communicate through a RESTApi which used json bodies. This allowed us to work independently from each other. This 
            allowed the project to be implemented quickly and efficient. There were not any major problems with the project except 
            towards the end were the back-end had a bit of problem with the database. However, these were quickly fixed and the
            application worked as intended. Even though the group aimed for grade 5 at first, because of other circumstances such as the
            the degree thesis and work, we decided to stick to the grade 3 requirements. Otherwise, the project was reasonable in the amount
            of time and the difficulty of it.

            The course overall was very well planned. The material was sufficient and the assignments were at times challenging but still
            manageable. However, the course should focus more on the practical part of web development and not have an exam as it is more
            useful for the students to have more practical experience. The availability of the lectures and material was very good, however,
            the lectures could be more well planned in the sense of how the information was delivered as it sometimes seemed not really 
            well planned. Otherwise, the course as a whole was very good, useful and insightful. I am satisfied with the course and on a 
            grade between 1-10, I would give it a 8. Mostly because the structure of it, the well written and helpful material as well as
            the fun assignments.

            I have learned the basic of web development which also has helped to easier understand how they are structured which in the 
            end has helped me on my workplace. Overall, a lot of new techniques has been learned which will be useful in what direction I
            want to take my developing career towards.
